# Executive Summary

This project develops a machine learning model to predict a movie's first-week box office revenue using historical theatrical, content, and market performance data. Instead of relying on traditional rule-based forecasting, the project leverages advanced boosting regression models such as **LightGBM**, **XGBoost**, **Gradient Boosting**, tree-based models such as **DecisionTree**, **RandomForest**, and neural network model such as **Multi-Layer Perceptron** to measure which model performs the best. After extensive model comparison, CatBoost was ultimately selected as the final production model.

The dataset was engineered from multiple sources, including theatrical performance, TMDB metadata, IMDb ratings, budget information, popularity metrics, release timing, and distribution strategy. Around **6,000 films** and **160+** engineered features were used after extensive preprocessing, encoding, and multilevel feature construction.

After evaluating multiple models using R² score, RMSE, MAE, cross-validation stability, and overfitting diagnostics, the final CatBoost model achieved:
* **R²:** 78.35%
* **RMSE:** ~$7.80M
* **MAE:** ~$3.42M
* Good generalization with only slight overfitting

Explainability was achieved through **SHAP** analysis, which revealed that theater count, theater penetration, IMDb rating, budget, franchise status, popularity, and release timing dominate revenue outcomes.

This project demonstrates how distribution strategy and audience perception outweigh production scale alone in determining opening-week financial performance—making it directly useful for studios, distributors, and investors.


# Business Problem
The global film industry faces high financial uncertainty, specially in periods like the financials crisis of 2008 or the COVID-19 pandemic. During these times production budgets often exceed tens or hundreds of millions of dollars, yet opening-week revenue remains highly volatile, making all intuitions unreliable. Studios must make critical pre-release decisions regarding:
* How widely a film should be released
* How much to invest in marketing
* Whether a project has blockbuster potential
* How franchise, cast, and critical reception influence early revenue

The central business question addressed in this project is:

> **Can a movie's first-week box office revenue be accurately predicted before release using distribution strategy, budget, ratings, popularity, and content features?**

Accurate early revenue forecasting allows studios to:
* Optimize theater allocation strategies
* Reduce financial risk
* Improve marketing budget efficiency
* Strengthen greenlighting decisions
* Improve investor confidence

By transforming raw movie metadata into a data-driven forecasting framework, this project enables studios to move from intuition-based planning to quantitative, explainable decision-making.


# Methodology
## Data Preparation
The dataset combines theatrical performance data, TMDB metadata, IMDb ratings, and budget information, merged on `tmdb_id`. The data preparation process:

1. **Yearly Data Extraction:** Extracted 26 years of box office data (2000-2025) using `boxoffice_api`, resulting in **423,496 rows** and **10 columns**. The scraper can be found in [this python script](data_preparation/data_extraction/1_yearly_data.py).

2. **TMDB ID Extraction:** Retrieved TMDB IDs for movie titles, dropping entries without valid IDs. The dataset contained **358,419 rows**. The scraper can be found in [this python script](data_preparation/data_extraction/2_tmdb_id.py).

3. **Feature Extraction:** Used TMDB IDs to extract genres, directors, actors, runtime, and origin countries. The scraper can be found in [this python script](data_preparation/data_extraction/3_features.py).

4. **Data Aggregation:** Aggregated data to predict **first 7 days of release** revenue and removed irrelevant columns. Which makes the final dataset a total of **6,127 rows** and **19 columns**. The aggregation script can be found in [this python script](data_preparation/data_extraction/4_data_aggregation.py).

5. **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, dropped irrelevant columns, renamed features, and corrected erroneous entries.

6. **Feature Engineering:** Created derived features including `theater_penetration`, `log_budget`, `is_franchise`, `release_month`, and `release_day`.

7. **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Applied One-Hot Encoding, kFold Encoding, Ordinal Encoding, MultiLabel Binarizer, and Count Encoding based on column characteristics.

8. **Standardization:** Normalized numerical features using `StandardScaler()`.

## Model Training & Performance Evaluation
A medley of regression models are trained and evaluated. These models are:
1. LightGBM Regressor
2. XGBoost Regressor
3. CatBoost Regressor
4. Gradient Boosting Regressor
5. AdaBoost Regressor
6. Decision Tree Regressor
7. Random Forest Regressor
8. ElasticNet Regressor
9. Multi-Layer Perceptron

All of the models are trained on the training dataset and evaluated on the test dataset using the following metrics:
* R² Score
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

The models are also evaluated for overfitting by comparing train and test R² scores. The first eight models are also checked for the top 10 most important features using their built-in feature importance attributes.

## Model Selection & Validation Strategy
The initial model comparison revealed a clear performance hierarchy among nine tested algorithms. **Gradient boosting variants** (CatBoost, LightGBM, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost) achieved **R² scores above 75%** and **RMSE below $8.3M** on test data, significantly outperforming traditional approaches (AdaBoost, Random Forest, Decision Tree, ElasticNet, MLP) which scored as low as **34% R²** with **RMSE exceeding $9M**.

This **7+ percentage point gap** demonstrates that gradient boosting methods successfully captured complex, non-linear box office revenue patterns. Given that 1% accuracy improvement translates to millions in projected revenue, we advanced only the **top 4 models** to rigorous validation testing:

**Validation Framework:**
1. **5-Fold Cross-Validation:** Measured mean R² and variance to identify stable predictors
2. **Fold-Wise Performance Analysis:** Used heatmaps to detect overfitting across data subsets  
3. **Generalization Testing:** Compared CV scores against held-out test performance

This three-stage validation ensures the final model maintains consistent accuracy across different data splits—critical for real-world deployment in production forecasting systems.

### Cross-Validation Performance Analysis
The 5-fold cross-validation revealed distinct performance patterns across the four gradient boosting models:

***Table 02: Cross-Validation Performance Comparison***

| ***LightGBM*** | 0.8092 | 0.7632 | 0.0460 | Good |
| ***Gradient Boosting*** | 0.8076 | 0.7552 | 0.0523 | Check |

#### Key Insights
CatBoost emerges as the clear winner across all validation metrics:
- **Highest accuracy:** 82.74% CV score with 77.85% test performance
- **Best stability:** Lowest variance (±1.89%) across 5 folds
- **Strong generalization:** Only 4.89% CV-test gap (well within acceptable threshold)
- **Consistent fold performance:** Minimal fluctuation across folds

While XGBoost shows the smallest CV-test difference (4.03%), its lower absolute performance and higher fold variability make it less reliable. Gradient Boosting's larger generalization gap (5.23%) raises minor overfitting concerns.

**Conclusion:** CatBoost is selected as the final production model due to its superior accuracy, stability, and generalization—making it the most dependable choice for forecasting first-week box office revenue.

# Predicting the Box Office Proceeds of **Avatar: Fire and Ash**
To forecast *Avatar: Fire and Ash*'s opening week revenue, we constructed a comprehensive feature set mirroring the model's training data structure. Pre-release attributes—including December 19, 2025 release date, estimated $400M budget, PG-13 rating, 195-minute runtime, and James Cameron as director—were sourced from publicly available industry reports and official announcements. Historical performance metrics from *Avatar* (2009) and *Avatar: The Way of Water* (2022) informed expectations for franchise appeal, while Google Trends data and social media sentiment provided real-time popularity proxies. Theater distribution estimates (4,200 screens, 97% penetration) were derived from industry benchmarks for December tentpole releases. Missing or uncertain features—such as exact cast configurations and marketing spend—were intelligently approximated using AI-assisted projections based on Cameron's filmography patterns. All categorical variables underwent the same encoding transformations applied during training (One-Hot, K-Fold, Ordinal), numerical features were standardized using `StandardScaler()`, and the resulting 150+ feature vector was fed into the Optuna-optimized CatBoost model to generate the final prediction.

After completing the full modeling and validation pipeline, the model projected that **Avatar: Fire and Ash** would generate approximately **$150.6 million** in its first seven days. The actual domestic box office proceeds reached **$153.7 million**, resulting in an absolute error of just **$3.08 million**—well within the model’s expected **$3.42M MAE**. This corresponds to a deviation of roughly **2%**, or **~98% accuracy**, on a real-world blockbuster release.

Given the model’s overall test-set performance (**78.35% R²**, **$7.80M RMSE**, **$3.42M MAE**), this close alignment reinforces its ability to generalize beyond historical data. The result validates the model’s production-ready performance and highlights how **wide theatrical distribution**, **franchise strength**, and **positive audience perception** jointly drive opening-week box office success.
